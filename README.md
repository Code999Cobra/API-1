# Windy JavaScript API

Windy JavaScript API is a simple-to-use library based on [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) **1.4.x**. It allows you to use everything Leaflet or JavaScript offers along with the Windy map visualizations we are using at [Windy.com](https://www.windy.com/).

This repository contains only Windy JavaScript API examples, check [https://api.windy.com/](https://api.windy.com/) for more info.
